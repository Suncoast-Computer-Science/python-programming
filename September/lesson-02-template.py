# String review
# Add two strings

# Input review
# Add input to string

# Warm up:

# Input 3 numbers, label them a, b 
# print the sum or a and b

# If statement

# boolean reivew

# if statements

# Questions:
# Take in 2 numbers, print out the greater number
# Numbers will not equal each other

# Take in 2 numbers, print out the smallest number
# If one of the numbers is 0 print bazinga!

# Take in 2 numbers, print "yes" if the difference of the two numbers is 2 and "no" if that is not the case


# Take in two numbers. If a is greater than b print "greater", if equal print "equal" or print print less

# find the issue with this code
# number = 101
# if number > 50:
#     print("number is greater than 50 but not greater than 100")
# elif number > 100:
#     print("number is greater than 100")
# else:
#     print("number is not greater than 50 or 100")

# For loops

# NOTE: i is a VARIABLE, but don't change it inside your loop. That's bad news

# Example:
# Print a 10, but with x amount of zeros
# i.e. print 10 but with 3 zeroes
# output = 1

# an alternate and valid way of doing this is with math functions we'll cover later
# feel free to google it tho

# Now make a string called dan
# you will take a number
# print dan that many times in one line with spaces

# REVIEWS
# print the remainder of x /2 (x can be any number)

# take 1 number as input
# if the number is divisible by 2, print even
# if the number is not divisible by 2, print odd
