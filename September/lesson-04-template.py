# The point of functions in big programs is that you don't have to repeat code that appears in multiple places (that can't be done in a loop)
# Just for those interested, DRY is an acronym for a design philosophy where you do NOT repeat yourself as little or not at all

# returning a value
# use the return keyword to give back a value that you can pass to either a variable or another function

# taking in a value
# You can define parameters to your functions, these are variables that you can pass to a function

# you can take in multiple paramters
